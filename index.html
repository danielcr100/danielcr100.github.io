    <h3>Presentation</h3>

    <p>
        With five years of professional experience in finance, my skills in financial analysis,
        financial advising and project tracking, can contribute to your organization.
        Within the past five years,
        I have developed valuable skills through challenging projects, which have led to the improvement of
        financial, analytical and research skills. It is also important to mention that during those five years
        I have also improved my soft skills such as,
        team management, communication and most importantly, work ethics
